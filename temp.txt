Right now this only displays a page with a text box and a button as shown in the image. Now is want to add proper authentication but use only a username. So now this login page should only have a textbox where user can enter their username, a submit button to log in, and a register button that will redirect users to a similar page. The username has to be unique and should have a proper regex check so no one can enter random patterns and break the site. The username can contain upper case and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters like (@, _, etc) that won't cause vulnerabilities and it cannot be left empty. When the user enters their username and presses the login button, the application should use the username to get the name of the user from the users table from the database and save it to a global state to show messages specific to the user once he logs in. When the user presses the register they should be redirected to a new page. This new page should have three text boxes one for first name one for last name and one for username. The username has to be unique and should have a proper regex check so no one can enter random patterns and break the site. The username can contain upper case and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters like (@, _, etc) that won't cause vulnerabilities and it cannot be left empty. The first name and last name text boxes should only have letters. First name is a required field while last name is optional. The new page should also contain two buttons; one to go back to the login page and one to register the user. When the user enters their details and presses register, The first name, last name, and username should be saved to the users table if the username doesn't already exist. if it does show an error to enter a unique username. The first name and last name should be saved such that the first letter is upper case and the rest are lower case. Then the user should be redirected to the login page. When the user enters the correct username and presses login, the application should check the database for the username and if it exists it should fetch the username and first name and store it in a global state. The user should be redirected to the file_handler page.

Write proper detailed and well-documented code to implement this. Make the code as modular as possible and provide their complete code files along with their location in my directory.

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
